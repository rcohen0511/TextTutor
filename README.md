# TwilioSend

To run on localhost, type:
	    
	                        node sms.js

Be sure to swap the environment variables on line 125 if you do not have environment variables with these names:

	process.env.TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER
	process.env.CELL_PHONE_NUMBER

The same goes for these at line 56-59

	process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
	process.env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
	
You should be able to hard-code the info in the outermost scope of sms.js, though, and be good to go. 


# Needed Fixes
1. Phone number input is hard-coded to 3, so successive server calls is not possible
2. This is not deployable on Heroku for some reason - need to do some research on Web Hooks
3. Many other code nightmares await because it's a hack 'n slash job of a script...
4. Stream of data is not linear - because the forms are not in the same order as the original process...

Potential fix: add webhook for get requests on /sms as on 117. 


Run Demo:
Inside TextTutor directory:
- npm install to rebuild any missing module (may not be neccessary)
- npm start
- Run "ngrok http 3000" to get webook for ngrok
- Go onto Twilio account associated with code and put in webhook for ngrok
- Text "join" to 19149966800 in order to join the class
